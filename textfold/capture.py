"""A page sent from the reader's own browser (extension/): what they see, signed in or subscribed, read as they see it.

The extension serializes the tab when the reader clicks its button (extension/snapshot.js: shadow roots spelled out,
frames put in place, what the browser did not show marked) and hands it to this program by native messaging: the
browser starts it, writes one message to its standard input, reads the answer from its standard output, and lets only
the extensions named in its manifest (allowed_origins) reach it. No port is opened. The page's cookies never leave the
browser: what comes is the page as it was drawn.

With it come its article as reading views read it in the browser (extension/reader.js: Defuddle's and Readability's).
A snapshot is stored as a web page of the library (webpage.py: web-<host>-<hash>), its HTML as it came beside it
(snapshot.html): its article the reading view's (article.html beside it), or, when neither has the words to read,
the one TextFold reads in the snapshot as in any web page. A page already in the library is not written over. When
TextFold runs, the new page's levels are asked of it at once, as for a page added on its landing.

The desktop app registers the host each time it starts (desktop/main.js: install --app), with its own Python and code,
for the extension as the Chrome Web Store gives it (STORE); pip's TextFold does it once, by hand. A message carries
the version of its make (PROTOCOL): a newer one than this TextFold knows is refused with update-textfold, and a hello
says which TextFold answers, for the extension to tell the reader what to do when none does (extension/setup.html).

  python3 -m textfold capture install [--extension <id>] [--browser chrome ...]   the host's manifest, for the store's
                                                                                 extension and those named
