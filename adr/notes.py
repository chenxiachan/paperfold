Answer in the language the question is written in (when that is unclear, in {langs.name(ui or lang)}). Conclusion first, then
the grounds. Be precise about what the paper says, and say so when it does not say it. At most {200 if whole else 120} words;
Markdown is fine, math as $...$.

Cite as you write: right after each statement drawn from the paper, put the number of the paragraph that bears it out most
directly in double brackets, like [[12]], or two, [[12]][[30]], when one is not enough. Every statement from the paper carries
a number, and only numbers listed here are used. A sentence that is your own inference or general knowledge rather than the paper's ends with [[?]].

Also give: the answer in one sentence of at most 20 words, with no numbers (takeaway); and two short questions a reader of
this paper might ask next (next): answerable from the paper, different from what has been asked, at most 15 words each, in the
language of the question.
